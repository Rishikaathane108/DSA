## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer or software developer. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms in C++. Each implementation is well-documented and follows best practices, making it easier for readers to comprehend and use in their projects.

## Data Structures

### 1. Array

- Description: An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Implementation: [array.cpp](data_structures/array.cpp)

### 2. Linked List

- Description: A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node.
- Implementation: [linked_list.cpp](data_structures/linked_list.cpp)

### 3. Stack

- Description: A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are inserted and removed from the same end, called the top.
- Implementation: [stack.cpp](data_structures/stack.cpp)

### 4. Queue

- Description: A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.
- Implementation: [queue.cpp](data_structures/queue.cpp)

### 5. Binary Tree

- Description: A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.
- Implementation: [binary_tree.cpp](data_structures/binary_tree.cpp)

### 6. Binary Search Tree

- Description: A binary search tree is a binary tree with the property that the left child's value is less than its parent, and the right child's value is greater.
- Implementation: [binary_search_tree.cpp](data_structures/binary_search_tree.cpp)

### 7. Heap

- Description: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, either being a min-heap or max-heap.
- Implementation: [heap.cpp](data_structures/heap.cpp)

### 8. Hash Table

- Description: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows quick retrieval and insertion through hashing.
- Implementation: [hash_table.cpp](data_structures/hash_table.cpp)

## Algorithms

### 1. Searching

- Description: Searching algorithms to find elements in data structures efficiently.
- Implementations: [linear_search.cpp](algorithms/searching/linear_search.cpp), [binary_search.cpp](algorithms/searching/binary_search.cpp)

### 2. Sorting

- Description: Sorting algorithms to arrange elements in a specific order.
- Implementations: [bubble_sort.cpp](algorithms/sorting/bubble_sort.cpp), [insertion_sort.cpp](algorithms/sorting/insertion_sort.cpp), [merge_sort.cpp](algorithms/sorting/merge_sort.cpp), [quick_sort.cpp](algorithms/sorting/quick_sort.cpp)

### 3. Recursion

- Description: Recursive algorithms and problems solved using recursion.
- Implementations: [factorial.cpp](algorithms/recursion/factorial.cpp), [fibonacci.cpp](algorithms/recursion/fibonacci.cpp)

### 4. Dynamic Programming

- Description: Dynamic programming solutions for various problems.
- Implementations: [fibonacci_dp.cpp](algorithms/dynamic_programming/fibonacci_dp.cpp), [knapsack_problem.cpp](algorithms/dynamic_programming/knapsack_problem.cpp)

### 5. Graph Algorithms

- Description: Graph-related algorithms like traversal, shortest path, etc.
- Implementations: [bfs.cpp](algorithms/graph_algorithms/bfs.cpp), [dfs.cpp](algorithms/graph_algorithms/dfs.cpp), [dijkstra.cpp](algorithms/graph_algorithms/dijkstra.cpp)
